Hello,

My name is Xenidis Pavlos and I was born and live in Greece.
English is not my first language so please excuse any errors in my writting.

This is a summary of various code of finished small projects, used as learning exercises in my journey to learning Python.
None of this is intended for use and should have many flaws, as their purpose is my introduction to Python and it's use.

This is created purely for tracking purposes, (and potentially for future nostalgia ":)" ).

By the time I created this github account, it has been a week since I started my journey,
So my first entries will be multiple projects.

If after reading all this you are still interested in navigating through my progress then:

In order to nagivate through my progress I will name the files as such:

{number represting order by which I wrote the code e.g my first project will be numbered 0} . {Name of the project}

e.g of navigation

0. Tip-Calculator
1. Treasure-Island
2. ...
